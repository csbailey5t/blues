Eli Cook is a young blues artist from Charlottesville, VA. He has developed quite a following in the last few years and has steady gigs in and around Washington, DC. The rest of the country, indeed, the world, is now getting the word of his talent. His voice is intense and nuanced and his guitar playing is exquisite. All Music Guide has called him the best blues singer of his generation and Guitar Edge Magazine has called him a blues legend in the making. Extraordinary claims for sure, but not without merit. His guitar playing is powerful and his voice is mature beyond his years. Eli has taken all the praise in stride, remaining dedicated to his craft and melding his influences into a unique musical vision. Find him at [elicook.com](http://elicook.com/).
