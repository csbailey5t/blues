The Rhythm Serenaders is classic small-group swing at its finest. The six piece combo is a hard-swinging dedication to the style and arrangements of the mid-to-late 1940′s, paying homage to the small groups of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, Roy Eldridge, Illinois Jacquet, Chu Berry, and other artists that mastered the small group sound, just as Big Band swing was waning in popularity, but before the full-on emergence of Bebop and modern jazz.Bandleader Michael Gamble’s 10+ years of work in every aspect of the global swing dance community informs the band’s repertoire and taste. The music will carry a dance floor all night long, but is just as comfortable in bars, clubs, and setting a classy tone for a private event. Michael Gamble and his Rhythm Serenaders embody the joy and infectious energy of mid-20th century American Jazz!

Brad had been swing dancing for over a decade before he began DJing, and he is currently the resident DJ for GottaSwing Charlotte. He has DJed for blues events across the Carolinas, including most recently at the Winter Blues in Greenville, SC and at blues dances in Charleston, SC and Durham, NC. Brad has built a reputation for bringing fun new music to every dance, and for singing along to songs as he plays them (including the instrumental ones!). He loves finding songs that really inspire dancers to move, and that send you scurrying out of your seat because you just have to find someone to dance with.
