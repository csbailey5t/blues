The Rhythm Serenaders is classic small-group swing at its finest. The six piece combo is a hard-swinging dedication to the style and arrangements of the mid-to-late 1940′s, paying homage to the small groups of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, Roy Eldridge, Illinois Jacquet, Chu Berry, and other artists that mastered the small group sound, just as Big Band swing was waning in popularity, but before the full-on emergence of Bebop and modern jazz.Bandleader Michael Gamble’s 10+ years of work in every aspect of the global swing dance community informs the band’s repertoire and taste. The music will carry a dance floor all night long, but is just as comfortable in bars, clubs, and setting a classy tone for a private event. Michael Gamble and his Rhythm Serenaders embody the joy and infectious energy of mid-20th century American Jazz! <br>
