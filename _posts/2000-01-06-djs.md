        <h4>Brad Nathanson</h4>
        <img src="img/headshots/brad_new.jpg" alt="Pic of Brad Nathanson" />
        <p>Brad had been swing dancing for over a decade before he began DJing, and he is currently the resident DJ for GottaSwing Charlotte. He has DJed for blues events across the Carolinas, including most recently at the Winter Blues in Greenville, SC and at blues dances in Charleston, SC and Durham, NC. Brad has built a reputation for bringing fun new music to every dance, and for singing along to songs as he plays them (including the instrumental ones!). He loves finding songs that really inspire dancers to move, and that send you scurrying out of your seat because you just have to find someone to dance with.</p>
